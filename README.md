# Bayesian-for-rats-growth-rate
Analysis of growth rate of rats by hierachical normal model. 
### Description
The aim of this analysis is to estimate the effect of time over unit growth of rats; to estimate overall
variation between rats over the weeks of measurements; and to estimate overall growth rate of rats.
The code for this report is based NormalGammaHierarchicalModel.R and sourcing the code from
DBDA2Eprograms folder from Doing Bayesian Analysis book by John K. Kruschke. All of the analysis of
this report is using R software, with extensive usage of coda, rjags, and runjags packages.
